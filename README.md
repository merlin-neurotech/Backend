### Current status:

We've figured out how to stream data and plot it in real time using PyQtGraph. We also have an understanding of the underlying data structures used in ble2lsl and pylsl

### Next Steps

Clean up the code and plan out the structure of the Working Title API. Implement that structure from end to end by offering plotting functionality.

Once the API structure has been designed and implemented (via a real-time time-domain plotting function), implement further features using this structure such as:
  - Non-Real Time (Offline) Implementation/Functionality
  - Automated Feature Extraction
  - Pre-trained Classification Models
  - dynamic/real-time plotting in both the time and frequency domain
  - static plotting in both time and frequency domain
  - filtering (real-time and offline)
  - conversion from time domain to frequency domain (power spectral density, PSD) both offline and in real time
  - conversion from frequency domain to time domain both offline and in real-time
  - real-time downsampling and resampling
  - anything else I think of that is useful and not too hard to do
